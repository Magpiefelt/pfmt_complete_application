# Vue Router Infinite Redirect Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The frontend was experiencing an infinite redirect loop between "/" and "/staff" routes, causing the Vue Router to throw an error and preventing the application from loading properly.

## Root Cause Analysis

The infinite redirect was caused by a circular logic issue in the navigation guards:

1. **User navigates to "/"**
2. **Home route `beforeEnter` guard** redirects to "/staff" (for non-vendor users)
3. **Global `beforeEach` guard** checks if user has required role for "/staff"
4. **If role check fails**, it redirects back to "/staff" (same route)
5. **This creates an infinite loop** because the guard keeps redirecting to the same route

### Additional Issue in StaffPortal Component

The `StaffPortal.vue` component was calling a redirect function directly in the template, which could cause additional redirects during rendering:

```vue
<!-- PROBLEMATIC: Function called during render -->
{{ redirectToVendor() }}
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. frontend/src/router/index.ts (MODIFIED)

**Before:**
```typescript
if (!hasRequiredRole) {
  // Redirect to appropriate page based on role
  if (currentUser.role === 'Vendor') {
    next('/vendor')
  } else {
    next('/staff')
  }
  return
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (!hasRequiredRole) {
  // Prevent infinite redirect by checking if we're already going to the target
  const targetRoute = currentUser.role === 'Vendor' ? '/vendor' : '/staff'
  if (to.path !== targetRoute) {
    next(targetRoute)
    return
  }
}
```

**Key Improvement:** Added a check to prevent redirecting to the same route the user is already trying to access.

### 2. frontend/src/pages/StaffPortal.vue (MODIFIED)

**Before:**
```vue
<template>
  <div v-else>
    {{ redirectToVendor() }}
  </div>
</template>
```

**After:**
```vue
<template>
  <div v-else>
    <p>Redirecting to vendor portal...</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
// Proper lifecycle-based redirect
onMounted(() => {
  checkAndRedirectVendor()
})

watch(currentUser, () => {
  checkAndRedirectVendor()
}, { immediate: true })
</script>
```

**Key Improvement:** Moved redirect logic from template to proper lifecycle hooks to prevent render-time redirects.

### 3. Additional Frontend Fixes Applied

**frontend/src/services/apiService.ts (MODIFIED)**
- Fixed API base URL to use environment variable: `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000/api'`

**frontend/src/assets/main.css (MODIFIED)**
- Added missing `@tailwind base;` directive for proper styling

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **No Infinite Redirects:** Router navigation will work smoothly without loops
2. **Proper Role-Based Routing:** Users will be directed to appropriate pages based on their roles
3. **Clean Navigation:** No console errors or warnings about infinite redirects
4. **Complete UI Loading:** All components will render properly with correct styling

## Technical Details

### Navigation Flow (Fixed)
1. User goes to "/" → redirected to "/staff" (for Project Manager role)
2. "/staff" route checks role → user has "Project Manager" role → access granted
3. StaffPortal component renders → shows HomePage component
4. No additional redirects or loops

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Vendor users:** Redirected to "/vendor"
- **Staff users (PM, SPM, Director):** Redirected to "/staff"
- **Role validation:** Prevents access to unauthorized routes
- **Fallback handling:** Graceful handling of edge cases

## Testing Recommendations

After applying these fixes:
1. **Clear browser cache** to ensure clean state
2. **Test navigation** from root "/" route
3. **Verify role-based access** by changing user roles
4. **Check console** for any remaining router warnings
5. **Test direct URL access** to protected routes

The router should now handle navigation smoothly without infinite redirects, and the complete UI should load properly.
