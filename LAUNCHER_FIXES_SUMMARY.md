# PFMT Launcher Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Primary Issue: Health Check Endpoint Mismatch
The main problem was that the backend server exposes a health check endpoint at `/health`, but all Docker configurations and launcher scripts were trying to access `/api/health`, which doesn't exist.

### Secondary Issues
1. **Missing Schema Files**: Several important schema files were not being loaded into the database during initialization
2. **Insufficient Wait Times**: The launcher script had too short wait times for slower machines
3. **Multiple Configuration Files**: The health check issue was present in multiple files across the project

## Files Modified

### 1. scripts/dev-up.sh (MODIFIED)
**Changes:**
- Fixed health check URL from `http://localhost:3000/api/health` to `http://localhost:3000/health`
- Increased retry attempts from 10 to 15
- Increased sleep time between retries from 2 to 3 seconds
- Increased initial wait time from 5 to 10 seconds

### 2. docker/docker-compose.dev.yml (MODIFIED)
**Changes:**
- Fixed backend health check from `/api/health` to `/health`
- Added missing schema files to database initialization:
  - `approval_audit_schema.sql`
  - `financial_management_schema.sql`
  - `vendor_management_schema.sql`
  - `wizard_schema.sql`

### 3. docker/docker-compose.prod.yml (MODIFIED)
**Changes:**
- Added missing schema files to production database initialization (same as dev)

### 4. backend/Dockerfile (MODIFIED)
**Changes:**
- Fixed health check from `/api/health` to `/health`

### 5. docker/backend.Dockerfile (MODIFIED)
**Changes:**
- Fixed health check from `/api/health` to `/health`

## Root Cause Analysis

The backend server (`backend/server.js`) correctly exposes the health endpoint at:
```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({
        status: 'OK',
        message: 'PFMT Integrated API Server is running',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        version: '1.0.0'
    });
});
```

However, all Docker health checks and the launcher script were incorrectly trying to access `/api/health`, causing:
- Docker containers to be marked as "unhealthy"
- Frontend container to wait indefinitely for backend health
- Launcher script to report "backend still starting up" even when running

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Backend Health Checks**: Will now correctly access `/health` endpoint
2. **Container Dependencies**: Frontend will properly wait for healthy backend
3. **Database Initialization**: All schema files will be loaded, preventing missing table errors
4. **Launcher Script**: Will correctly detect when services are ready
5. **Improved Reliability**: Longer wait times accommodate slower machines

## Testing Performed

- ✅ Verified health endpoint exists at `/health` in backend/server.js
- ✅ Confirmed all referenced schema files exist in database directory
- ✅ Validated bash script syntax for dev-up.sh
- ✅ Validated YAML syntax for all Docker compose files
- ✅ Verified all file paths and references are correct

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Environment Compatibility**: The current scripts assume `docker compose` (plugin). For systems with only `docker-compose` (standalone), consider adding compatibility detection.

2. **Health Check Consistency**: Consider adding a `/api/health` alias route that forwards to `/health` to maintain backward compatibility if needed.

3. **Monitoring**: The enhanced wait times and retry logic should provide better feedback for debugging startup issues.

## Files Ready for Deployment

All modified files maintain existing functionality while fixing the launcher issues. The changes are minimal and focused only on the health check endpoints and database initialization.
