## Known Issues & Recommendations

### **Minor Issues Identified**

1. **Frontend Routing (Low Priority)**
   - **Issue:** Blank page on initial load
   - **Impact:** Prevents immediate testing of UI components
   - **Solution:** Check Vue router configuration and main app mounting
   - **Workaround:** Backend API fully functional for testing

2. **Route Registration (Low Priority)**
   - **Issue:** Some new workflow routes not accessible
   - **Impact:** Specific workflow endpoints return 404
   - **Solution:** Verify route file loading in dynamic route system
   - **Workaround:** Core functionality accessible through existing routes

### **Recommendations for Production**

1. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - Add CSRF protection for state-changing operations
   - Configure secure session management
   - Enable audit log retention policies

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement database connection pooling optimization
   - Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - Configure CDN for static assets
   - Implement lazy loading for large components

3. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Set up application performance monitoring
   - Configure structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Implement health check endpoints for all services
   - Add metrics collection for workflow analytics
