## Data Migration Procedures

### Migration Planning and Preparation

Data migration from the existing LowDB JSON-based storage to the PostgreSQL relational database requires comprehensive planning and preparation to ensure data integrity, minimize downtime, and preserve all existing functionality. The migration process involves analyzing existing data structures, mapping JSON fields to relational database columns, and developing transformation procedures that handle data type conversions and relationship establishment.

Migration planning begins with comprehensive data analysis that identifies all existing data entities, relationships, and business rules that must be preserved during the migration process. Analyze project data structures including basic project information, location details, team assignments, financial data, and audit information to ensure complete data coverage and proper relationship mapping.

Data validation procedures ensure that all existing data meets the quality and consistency requirements of the target PostgreSQL schema. Implement validation scripts that identify data quality issues, missing required fields, and inconsistent data formats that must be addressed before migration execution. Develop data cleansing procedures that resolve identified issues while preserving data integrity and business meaning.

Migration testing procedures validate the migration process using representative data sets and ensure that all data is correctly transformed and accessible in the target system. Establish test environments that replicate production conditions, execute migration procedures with test data, and validate that all application functionality operates correctly with migrated data.

### Migration Execution

Migration execution involves running the automated migration scripts that transform and transfer data from the source JSON files to the target PostgreSQL database. The migration process implements transaction management to ensure data consistency, comprehensive error handling to manage migration failures, and progress tracking to monitor migration status and completion.

Pre-migration procedures include creating database backups, validating source data integrity, and establishing rollback procedures that enable recovery in case of migration failures.

The migration process executes in phases that handle different data entities in appropriate dependency order. User data migration occurs first to establish user accounts and authentication information required by other entities. Company and vendor data migration follows to establish organizational relationships. Project data migration occurs last to ensure that all referenced entities are available for relationship establishment.

Post-migration validation procedures verify that all data has been correctly transferred and is accessible through the application interface. Execute comprehensive testing that validates data integrity, relationship consistency, and application functionality with migrated data. Compare source and target data to ensure completeness and accuracy of the migration process.

### Migration Validation and Verification

Migration validation ensures that all data has been correctly transferred and that the application operates properly with the migrated data. Validation procedures include data integrity checks, functional testing, and performance verification that confirm successful migration completion and readiness for production operation.

Data integrity validation compares source and target data to ensure that all records have been correctly transferred, all relationships have been properly established, and all data values are accurate and complete. Execute automated validation scripts that perform record counts, data checksums, and relationship verification to identify any discrepancies or missing data.

Functional validation involves comprehensive testing of all application features using the migrated data to ensure that all functionality operates correctly and that users can access and modify data as expected. Test user authentication, project creation and modification, reporting functionality, and administrative features to verify complete system operation.

Performance validation ensures that the application operates with acceptable performance characteristics using the migrated data and PostgreSQL database. Execute performance testing that measures response times, throughput, and resource utilization under typical usage patterns. Compare performance metrics with baseline measurements to ensure that migration has not degraded system performance.
