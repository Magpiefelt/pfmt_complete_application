## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Project Manager Workflow
- **Create New Project**: Navigate to "Create New Project" from homepage → Complete wizard
- **Draft Management**: Create draft version → Edit project details → Submit for approval
- **Gate Meetings**: Schedule gate meeting → Complete meeting → Confirm version submission prompt

### 2. Director Workflow
- **Project Overview**: View only approved project versions in project listings
- **Approval Process**: Review pending versions → Approve or reject with comments
- **Gate Meeting Oversight**: View all gate meetings across projects (read-only)

### 3. Auto-Submission Testing
- **Manual Trigger**: Use API endpoint `/api/scheduled-submissions/trigger` (Admin/Director only)
- **Configuration**: Update auto-submission settings via `/api/scheduled-submissions/config`
- **Monitoring**: Check submission history via `/api/scheduled-submissions/history`

### 4. Version Management Testing
- **Dual Version System**: Verify only one approved and one draft version exist
- **View Toggle**: Switch between draft and approved views in project detail page
- **Draft Indicators**: Confirm pending draft badges appear in project listings

- `GET /api/gate-meetings/:projectId` - Get project meetings

### Project Versions
- `GET /api/phase2/projects/:id/versions` - Get project versions
- `POST /api/phase2/projects/:id/versions` - Create new version
- `PUT /api/phase2/versions/:id/submit` - Submit version for approval
- `PUT /api/phase2/versions/:id/approve` - Approve version

- `PUT /api/scheduled-submissions/projects/:id/auto-submission` - Toggle project setting

## Configuration Management

### Auto-Submission Settings
- **Global Toggle**: Enable/disable auto-submission system-wide
- **Schedule**: Configurable cron expression (default: last day of month at 9 AM)
- **Eligibility**: Minimum age requirement for draft versions (default: 7 days)
- **Project Level**: Individual project auto-submission toggle

### System Configuration
Stored in `system_config` table:
- `auto_submission_enabled`: Global toggle
- `auto_submission_cron`: Cron expression
- `auto_submission_min_age_days`: Minimum age requirement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - Check database credentials in `.env`
   - Ensure database exists and migrations are applied

2. **Auto-Submission Not Running**
   - Check server logs for cron job initialization
   - Verify timezone configuration (America/Edmonton)
   - Confirm `auto_submission_enabled` is true in system_config

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Verify user roles are correctly assigned
   - Check route-level permission middleware
   - Confirm JWT token is valid and not expired

4. **Version Submission Issues**
   - Ensure only one draft version exists per project
   - Verify user has PM/SPM role for submission
   - Check that project has `auto_submission_enabled = true`

### Logging and Monitoring
- Backend logs include detailed auto-submission execution
- Database audit trail in `scheduled_submissions` table
- Frontend console logs for debugging UI interactions

## Migration Notes

### From Previous System
- Existing PFMT extractor functionality preserved at `/pfmt-extractor` (deprecated)
- All existing API endpoints remain functional
- Database schema is backward compatible

### Breaking Changes
- PFMT extractor removed from main navigation (still accessible via direct URL)
- Vendor role no longer has access to project creation
- New project creation now requires wizard completion

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Email Notifications**: Implement actual email sending for auto-submission results
2. **Advanced Scheduling**: Support for custom submission schedules per project
3. **Workflow Templates**: Predefined gate meeting sequences for different project types
4. **Integration APIs**: Prepare for future CMS and 1GX integrations
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Enhance mobile experience for field users

### Technical Debt
- Consolidate duplicate `completeMeeting` functions in EnhancedGateMeetings
- Implement proper error boundaries in Vue components
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor auto-submission logs monthly
- Review and clean up old submission logs (automated)
- Update system configuration as business rules change
- Backup database regularly

### Performance Monitoring
- Database query performance
- Auto-submission execution time
- Frontend loading times
- API response times

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully addresses all the original requirements:

✅ **Gate Meeting Integration**: Complete milestone tracking with workflow synchronization
✅ **Dual Version System**: Draft vs approved version management with director oversight
✅ **New Project Wizard**: Streamlined creation process with PFMT integration option
✅ **Auto-Submission**: Scheduled monthly submission with comprehensive configuration
✅ **Role-Based Access**: Proper permission controls throughout the system
