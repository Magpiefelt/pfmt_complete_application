# PFMT Application Analysis and Refactoring Todo

## ✅ Completed Analysis Tasks

- [x] Clone repository and examine structure
- [x] Analyze backend architecture and API structure
- [x] Examine frontend Vue.js application organization
- [x] Review database schema and data relationships
- [x] Assess current refactoring state and patterns
- [x] Identify legacy components requiring modernization
- [x] Document technology stack and dependencies
- [x] Create comprehensive codebase analysis report

## 🔄 Next Steps for Refactoring

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Setup ESLint configuration with Vue.js and TypeScript rules
- [ ] Add Prettier for consistent code formatting
- [ ] Configure pre-commit hooks for code quality
- [ ] Fix any TypeScript compilation issues
- [ ] Document coding standards and refactoring patterns
- [ ] Create component development guidelines

### Short-term Goals (Next 1-2 Months)
- [ ] Refactor BudgetManager.vue (26.4KB) into modular components
- [ ] Modernize BudgetTransferLedger.vue with composable integration
- [ ] Break down ReportingDashboard.vue into focused widgets
- [ ] Standardize FiscalYearCalendar.vue component
- [ ] Integrate ProjectVersionsManager.vue with existing composables
- [ ] Refactor AgendaGenerator.vue following established patterns
- [ ] Setup Vitest for unit testing infrastructure
- [ ] Create component testing utilities

### Medium Priority Improvements
- [ ] Create useVendors composable for vendor management
- [ ] Implement vendor performance analytics
- [ ] Add advanced data visualization with Chart.js
- [ ] Enhance mobile responsiveness and touch interfaces
- [ ] Implement custom report builder functionality
- [ ] Add export capabilities (PDF, Excel)
- [ ] Create automated report scheduling

### Long-term Enhancements
- [ ] Plan CMS integration architecture
- [ ] Design 1GX integration strategy
- [ ] Implement real-time collaboration features
- [ ] Add advanced workflow automation
- [ ] Create API ecosystem for third-party integrations
- [ ] Implement machine learning for project insights

## 📋 Component Refactoring Checklist

### For Each Legacy Component:
- [ ] Break down into focused, single-responsibility components (<500 lines each)
- [ ] Extract business logic into composables
- [ ] Implement service layer for API calls
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces and types
- [ ] Create unit tests for components and composables
- [ ] Update documentation and examples
- [ ] Ensure consistent error handling
- [ ] Verify responsive design and accessibility

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- [ ] All components under 500 lines
- [ ] 100% TypeScript coverage
- [ ] ESLint/Prettier compliance
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage

### Architecture Consistency
- [ ] All components use Composition API
- [ ] Business logic extracted to composables
- [ ] API calls through service layer
- [ ] Consistent error handling patterns

### Performance
- [ ] Improved bundle size through code splitting
- [ ] Lazy loading implementation
- [ ] Optimized database queries
- [ ] Caching strategies implemented

## 📝 Notes for Development Team

### Established Patterns (Follow These)
- Project detail system refactoring approach
- Composable-driven business logic
- Service layer API abstraction
- TypeScript interface definitions
- Component prop and event patterns

### Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)
- Large monolithic components (>1000 lines)
- Direct API calls in components
- Mixed Composition/Options API usage
- Inconsistent error handling
- Missing TypeScript types
